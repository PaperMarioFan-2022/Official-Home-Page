# Hello! Welcome to my home page!

This is my official repository website for more information about me and what I am on.

My name is Matthew, but you can call me Matt for short. I love video games, music, art, and memes. I live in the West side of the USA, and that's it.

I am on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/PaperMarioFan2022/">Scratch</a>, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Zydrolic/">GitHub</a>, Replit, and Snap!

More will be added here in the future. :)

Image brokey. Working on fixing it.
